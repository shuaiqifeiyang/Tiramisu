[2064. Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimized-maximum-of-products-distributed-to-any-store/)

## Problem

Given a integer array containing m elements, we want to split the element to get a new array with n elements. The largest element of the new array is `maxn`, find the minimum value of `maxn`.

## Idea

Binary Search

Each element x in the original array needs to occupy $\lceil$x/maxn$\rceil$ positions in the split array. We use the binary search method to find maxn so that the number of positions in the split array is equal to n.

Left part makes the size of new array greater than n. Right part makes the size of new array smaller than n.

## Code

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minimizedMaximum(int n, vector<int>& quantities) {
        int left=1, right=100000;
        while(left<right){
            int mid=left+(right-left)/2;
            int countOfStore=0;
            for(int q: quantities){
                countOfStore+=(q+mid-1)/mid;
            }
            if(countOfStore>n){
                left=mid+1;
            }else if(countOfStore<=n){
                right=mid;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```
