Overview of machine learning

<!--more-->

One possible definition: a set of methods that can automatically **detect patterns** in data, and then use the uncovered patterns to **predict future data**, or to perform other kinds of decision making **under uncertainty**.

Key ingredients in machine learning:

* Data
* Modeling
* Prediction

Different flavors of learning problems:

* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning
* Reinforcement learning
