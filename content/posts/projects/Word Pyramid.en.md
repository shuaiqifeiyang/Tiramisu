## Why develop this game?
Why is it so easy for people to indulge in games, but not to work and study? Because there is a complete set of psychological methods behind the game to guide you to indulge in it, including instant feedback, stage goals, virtual game items, random lottery... I was thinking that if the game mechanics and learning are combined can people also indulge in learning? Based on these ideas, and it happens that the Covid-19 pandemic has given me a lot of time at home, I turned this idea into a mobile game.
## What's the game?
This is a business game. Players earn gold coins by memorizing English words. The gold coins can be used to build houses and open up the land. Although it looks like a game at first glance, it is actually a complete word recitation app. As a former TOEFL test taker, I divided the TOEFL words into categories based on my experience. Some lists are subject words, and some lists are words that are easy to confuse. I also try to keep the Chinese meaning of words concise, so that we can recite the words more efficiently. In addition, this APP also supports word pronunciation. 
This game has been put on the APP Store, [download link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/word-pyramid/id1500563600)

## How to develope this game?
I completed the design, development, and art of the game alone. The entire game is developed based on the Unity engine, Krita is used to draw the UI, and MagicaPixel is used for 3D modeling.
## Next steps
At present, this game has achieved 200+ downloads and a 5.0 rating at App Store. My next plan is:

1. Make some changes to the design, adding guidance to allow players to understand the game more quickly.
2. Make some optimizations to the art, adding the switch between night and day.
3. Add more word libraries.
